Any volunteers?

- Write some unit tests
- Show sales graphs instead of tables in the dashboard
- PayPal Website Payments Standard integration (very low priority for me -AK)
- MySQL compatibility (again, very low priority for me -AK)
- Refactor code to be RESTful and well structured. orders_controller could use some help in that department
- A desktop client someday after the REST refactoring is done?

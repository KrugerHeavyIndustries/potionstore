== Welcome to Potion Store

Features:

- PayPal Website Payments Pro support
- PayPal Express Checkout support
- Google Checkout support
- Administration interface with some simple sales charts
- Coupons
- Send lost license page (http://mycompany.com/store/lost_license)
- Google Analytics e-commerce transaction tracking support for PayPal and credit card orders


== Dependencies

- Rails 2.0 or higher
- Postgresql (a lot of people have gotten it to work with MySQL though)
- ruby-debug rubygem (I'm forcing this on you, but you really owe it
  to yourself to try it out. It's way better than the built-in
  breakpointer)


== Installation

This is a brief outline of the steps required to get Potion Store up and running.  I'll assume that
you have basic rails knowledge or some Google skills.

- Edit the following config files to suit your needs

  config/store.yml
  config/paypal.yml
  config/google_checkout.yml

- Setup database
  - Install Postgresql if you haven't
  - Create the store_development database.
  	Make sure to set the encoding of the database to UTF8.
	I recommend pgAdmin for Postgresql newcomers.
  - Edit config/database.yml
  - run "rake db:migrate" to import schema
   
- Install gem dependency:
  gem install ruby-debug

- Run script/server and test through
  http://localhost:3000/store and
  http://localhost:3000/admin

- Replace the default license key generator in lib/licensekey.rb with your own

- If you are setting up Google Checkout, log into your Google Checkout account (sandbox or live), go
  to Settings->Integration and put in your URL that corresponds to the following:

  https://secure.potionfactory.com/store/notification/gcheckout

  That is the URL that Google uses to make callbacks. If you don't set this up, your customers will
  not get their orders delivered by email.


== Final Notes

- I'd appreciate it if you kept the "Powered by Potion Store" link in the footer. It'll help more developers find the project.

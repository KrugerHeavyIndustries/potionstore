== Dependencies

- Rails 1.2 or higher
- Postgresql
- ruby-debug rubygem (I'm forcing this on you, but you really owe it
  to yourself to try it out. It's way better than the built-in
  breakpointer)


== Installation

This is a brief outline of the steps required to get Potion Store up and running.
I'll assume that you have basic rails knowledge or some Google skills.

- Edit the following config files to suit your needs

  config/store.yml
  config/paypal.yml
  config/google_checkout.yml

- Setup database
  - Install Postgresql if you haven't
  - Create the store_development database.
  	Make sure to set the encoding of the database to UTF8.
	I recommend pgAdmin for Postgresql newcomers.
  - Edit config/database.yml
  - run "rake db:migrate" to import schema
   
- Install gem dependency:
  gem install ruby-debug

- Install PayPal API access certificates into config/certs

- Run script/server and test through
  http://localhost:3000/store and
  http://localhost:3000/admin

- Replace the default license key generator in lib/licensekey.rb with your own
